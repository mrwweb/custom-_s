# {Site Name} Theme

A theme supporting the block editor based on _s (with lots of changes ðŸ˜ƒ).

## Build Process
This site uses a Gulp build process in order to support SASS with autoprefixer and logical properties syntax. Gulp also minifies and uglifies JS and provides Live Reload.

Edit CSS and JS files in `/src/`

See `package.json` and `gulpfile.js` for details.

To run build from `/wp-content/themes/{themename}/`

```
$ npm install
$ gulp
```

## Dev Environment
Make sure your editor supports `.editorconfig` for some very basic coding standards autoformatting.

## Other Notes
See `/wp-content/mu-plugins/` non-theme related site changes.
